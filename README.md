# World_Weather_Analysis

Although the PlanMyTrip App was a successs, beta testers have recommended a few changes to make the app even better.  One of the changes will be adding a weather description.  Users will input statements to indentify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will then choose four cities to create a travel itineary. This will be done by using the Google Maps Directions API.

THe updates to the PlanMyTrip App was successful. Not only were we able to show the current weather descriptions, we were able to show a potential roadtrip in Africa.  The code can easily be changed to show other trips in different weather condtions.
